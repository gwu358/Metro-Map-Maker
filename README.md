# Metro-Map-Maker
The project is built based on the Software Requirement Specification. Please refer to the file "MetroMapMakerSRS.pdf" about the specification. This project is compiled using NetBean IDE with JavaFX foramework. The data structure includes ArrayList and Stack.

Note that the Desktop Java Framework will be provided inside DesktopJavaFramework.jar, a Java ARchive file that will encapsulate the entire framework. The data of this application are stored in the mmmFiles, using JsonFile. Every time when a file is being saved, the data such as color, coordination of lines and stations are converted to Json Object. The JsonArrayBuilder is imported so it can organize the data in an array. The JsonWriter writes the JsonObject to a file which will be saved in the “work” folder insider the metroMapMaker project. Last but not least, the record about the recent saved files are store in “recent.txt” in the metroMapMaker project. The name of each saved file is stored in lines in the text file.
